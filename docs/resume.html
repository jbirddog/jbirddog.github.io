    <a id="yahoo"><b>Yahoo!/Yahoo/Oath/Verizon</b> - 
      <i>Aug 2008 to June 2021</i></a>
  </h3>
  <h4>Senior Principle Engineer, Partnerships/Mobile</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Developed from scratch and released the official Yahoo iOS Mail application in 12 weeks. This
      multithreaded universal binary works in landscape and portrait modes, supports multiple users, has full
      offline support, complete bidirectional sync, is encrypted at rest and has full theme support built in. This
      application has been #1 in Productivity numerous times, has over 10 million daily active users and a
      crash rate of 0.02%.</li>
    <li>Performed team lead functions for iOS Mail</li>
    <li>Approved designs for backend APIs and internal SDKs consumed by Yahoo mobile applications.</li>
    <li>Improved the performance and stability of multiple Yahoo iOS applications and SDKs.</li>
    <li>Wrote a cross platform C library that matches user-defined patterns against an arbitrary stream of
      events in constant time. This library was used in both iOS and Android applications to drive contextual
      features.</li>
    <li>Designed and developed a custom C application to identify issues in code that would cause increased
      build times. Using this tool build times for iOS Mail were reduced from tens of minutes to under a
      minute. This greatly increased developer productivity across the team. Libclang was used for parsing.</li>
    <li>Implemented custom versions of Apple’s ibtool and actool which resulted in local builds being 45
      seconds faster for iOS Mail.</li>
    <li>Designed and developed a custom C application to identify when properties are accessed inconsistently
      with regards to locking. This tool resulted in the identification and correction of several threading related
      bugs and crashes. Libclang was used for parsing.</li>
    <li>Devised a method to remotely log assertions that would have been hit in production code. This greatly
      helped in tracking down the root cause of many crashes and problems reported by end users.</li>
    <li>Devised a method to efficiently report the status of all feature buckets when an exception occurs. This
      helped in debugging issues when a combination of buckets were on or off.</li>
    <li>Ported C macros to Swift while maintaining the semantics of the macro, namely preventing eager
      evaluation of parameters and respecting caller line, column and file values to help logging and
      assertions.</li>
    <li>Developed the iOS client portion of a secure multi-client real time chat feature that required instant
      display of each user’s keystrokes and status changes.</li>
    <li>Designed and developed a custom Swift application to parse the serialized AST nodes for the Clang
      and Swift front ends. This allowed for auditing of codebases without the need to have libclang as a
      dependency. Objective-C and Swift code can be compared allowing for lower false positives in a multi-
      language codebase. Whole program analysis is supported as well as querying the codebase to help
      identify issues.</li>
    <li>Designed and developed a custom C application to automatically generate a suite of unit tests for a
      given application. This work saved countless hours during drastic changes to our underlying codebases
      and resulted in patent US9146842.</li>
    <li>Designed a system to deploy targeted fixes to mobile users that experienced a crash while using a
      Yahoo application. This system resulted in patent filing US20160124799.</li>
    <li>Wrote a complete Objective-C parser and lexer in Python to perform custom auditing of our iOS
      codebases. This was used when bugs in libclang prevented it from being used.</li>
    <li>Designed and implemented a system that cross referenced crash reports to debug logs as well as the
      associated code files of a given application.</li>
    <li>Designed and implemented a library that forced existing race conditions within an application to occur.
      This greatly helped in debugging hard to reproduce crashes.</li>
    <li>Developed an unbranded real time group chat application during which time I devised a method to
      improve the performance for type-ahead search results from a finite dataset, resulting in patent
      US8965909.</li>
    <li>Ported in house Dependency Injection framework from Java to Objective-C.</li>
    <li>Designed and helped implement the rewrite of existing RDP Terminal Services application to a native
      set-top box application. A new framework was designed to allow developers to create TV-based
      applications without concern for SD, SDW or HD resolutions. Other platform specific oddities such as
      memory restrictions and lack of cookie support where dealt with at the framework level to allow
      developers to focus on their task at hand.</li>
    <li>Created custom PHP extension in C to inject post data into an apache apr table to trick subsequent
      code into believing the client application had native cookie support. This allowed rich set-top box
      applications that fit nicely into the existing Yahoo ecosystem.</li>
    <li>Helped design and fully implemented search functionality for our web based DVR application. Search
      leveraged a combination of MySQL and NoSQL databases to perform show title, cast and crew as well
      as channel searches.</li>
    <li>Helped design and fully implemented search assist functionality for our intra-application search. Search
      assist utilized both MySQL and custom application logic to sort and order results in a method described
      in patent US8250077.</li>
    <li>Created custom Java plugin for in-house NoSQL implementation to allow it to serve as a remote API
      cache layer as well as an application data store.</li>
    <li>Created custom Java plugin for in-house NoSQL implementation to allow it to cross reference relational
      data stored in MySQL at query time.</li>
    <li>Developed custom charting tool so AT&amp;T U-verse customers could visualize their finance.yahoo.com
      data on their televisions.</li>
    <li>Designed and implemented a backend process to perform a nightly EPG refresh for our web based
      DVR application. EPG data was provided in a 1.2GB XML file which was downloaded, parsed and
      loaded into MySQL as well as a custom in-house NoSQL database.</li>
    <li>Implemented process to allow front-end application servers to hot swap their MySQL databases with
      those present on the back-end EPG servers. This allowed for zero downtime deployments without the
      need for MySQL replication.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Director of Engineering, Mobile</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Successfully led the iOS Mail team through several high impact projects which where key to 
      quarterly and annual business goals. I achieved a 100% approval rating from my team during our 
      corporate annual surveys.</li>
    <li>Successfully organized and led several cross-functional war room initiatives to ensure projects 
      were completed on time.</li>
    <li>Acted as talent magnet within the company as I attracted 5 high performing internal transfers 
      without poaching.</li>
    <li>Ran several simultaneous projects at a time utilizing the appropriate members of my team. Allocations 
      were done based on strengths and growth needs depending on the deadline and priority of each project.</li>
    <li>Went to great lengths to ensure that members of my team were known within the company. This included 
      partnering closely with internal PR and marketing, rallying support for internal recognition awards 
      and coordinating presentations at corporate and organizational meetings.</li>
    <li>I empowered my employees to take risks where appropriate and worked hard to give them the encouragement 
      and freedom to succeed in ways they never thought possible. Members of my team routinely filed patents, 
      pitched new features and led cross team architecture discussions.</li>
    <li>Held a weekly Team Hour during which the team took turns presenting design patterns, data structures 
      and algorithms and new language features.</li>
    <li>Partnered closely with members of other organizations and divisions to ensure that dependencies were 
      aligned, priorities were set and resources were allocated appropriately.</li>
